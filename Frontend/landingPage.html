                      Did you know that machine learning models can help you predict heart
                      disease pretty accurately? In this app, you can estimate your chance of
                      heart disease (yes/no) in seconds!
                      <br>
                      Here, a logistic regression model using an undersampling technique was
                      constructed using survey data of over 300k US residents from the year
                      2020. This application is based on it because it has proven to be better
                      than the random forest (it achieves an accuracy of about 80%, which is
                      quite good).
                      To predict your heart disease status, simply follow the steps bellow:
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <ol type="1">
                          <li>Enter the parameters that best describe you;</li>
                          <li>Press the "Predict" button and wait for the result.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <h4>
                            Keep in mind that this results is not equivalent to a medical diagnosis! This
                            model would never be adopted by health care facilities because of its less
                            than perfect accuracy, so if you have any problems, consult a human doctor.
